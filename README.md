This is a repository for a programming class exercise


Note for the teacher: 

We tried to make some changes in show() and we notice that when we eliminate the "\t" ,
in some iterations, some lines print the characters bigger than the others and we weren't 
able to fix it. Why is this happening? 

We also use for printing the result  black hearts and white hearts.
